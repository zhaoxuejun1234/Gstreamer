## Introduction
This repo contains basic usage test of Gstreamer.Source code is from the offical tutorial.
This repo focuses on  the commonly used features and components of Gstreamer, which is for the insight and preparation of DeepStream.
### Remind
Gstreamer is constructd based on C. Actually the sourc file can be renamed to ".cpp" format giving the "static_cast" into account. Transferring into C++ is unnecessary considering facts that understading the construction of a complex pipeline is the first pirority.
