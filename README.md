## Introduction
This repo contains basic usage test of Gstreamer.Source code is from the offical tutorial.
This repo focuses on  the commonly used features and components of Gstreamer, which is for the insight and preparation of DeepStream.
### Suggestion
(1) Learning basic elements of Gstreamer and looking into basic elements through "gst-inspect-1.0"  
(2) Learning how to link a pipeline when callback function is imported  
(3) Learing multi-threading of pipeline and gestreamer buffer usage  
### Reminder
Gstreamer is constructd based on C. Actually the sourc file can be renamed to ".cpp" format giving the "static_cast" into account. Transferring into C++ is unnecessary considering facts that understading the construction of a complex pipeline is the first pirority.
